    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter
        </li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat krumkake iron on stove over medium heat. You can also use an electric krumkake or pizzelle iron.</li>
        <li>Cream together the butter and sugar in a bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix well using a spoon. Pour in the milk, flour, vanilla, and butter flavoring; mix well.</li>
        <li>Place a teaspoon of the batter on the preheated iron, and press together. Cook until browned, about 30 seconds per side, depending on the heat. Remove from the iron and quickly roll up around a stick or around a cone before they harden.</li>
