    <h2>How I found this recipe ?</h2>
    <p>Both of my parents are Norwegian. Growing up, my mom used to make these meatballs. Later in life, my dad took over the meal prep, and he became a great cook. My mom did a good job, but my dad perfected the recipe. I think of him every time I make them now.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 large onion, grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 pounds 85% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <h4>For gravy</h4>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
                <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 dash cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 dash white pepper</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a jelly roll pan.</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, milk, eggs, onion, ginger, salt, nutmeg, garlic, and black pepper in a mixing bowl. Let stand until bread crumbs absorb milk, about 5 minutes. Stir until just mixed and add ground beef. Mix until well blended. Shape mixture into 1-inch meatballs and place on the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 18 minutes. Set meatballs aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in flour and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Slowly add broth; cook and stir gravy until smooth and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Blend in cream, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Gently stir cooked meatballs into gravy and heat through, but do not boil, about 5 minutes more.</li>
    
    </ol>
